The below images are examples of applying Grad-CAM (middle) and Combi-CAM (right) to Talk2Car dataset images (left). 

We find that Combi-CAM consistently outperforms Grad-CAM in accurately localizing landmarks. Effective geolocalization relies heavily on attention to specific architectural elements, such as facades and roof corners. Windows are also highlighted when their size is large enough to fit into the receptive field of the neurons in a particular layer.
