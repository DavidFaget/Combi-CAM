The below images are examples of applying Grad-CAM (middle) and Combi-CAM (right) to Talk2Car dataset images. We observe that Combi-CAM consistently outperforms Grad-CAM in terms of accurate landmarks localization.
Specifically we observe that for accuarte geolocalization, most of the attention is paid to particular architectural elements in the buildings, including facades and roof corners. Windows are also highlighted when their size is large enough to fit into the receptive field of the neurons in a particular layer.
