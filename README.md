# Combi-CAM: Explainable Geolocalization for Autonomous Driving

Official repository for Combi-CAM: Explainable Geolocalization for Autonomous Driving paper.

## Inference with explainability methods:

```bash
!python inference.py --image_url "..." --use_cpu --layercam --gradcam --gradcamplusplus --scorecam --combicam
```

Recommended to generate figures one by one to avoid RAM overload.

It is also possible to use --image_path instead of --image_url.

## Additional Talk2Car Examples
Additional illustrations of the application of Combi-CAM on Talk2Car [2] dataset images can be found in the examples folder.
